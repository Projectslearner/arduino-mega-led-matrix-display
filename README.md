# LED Matrix Display

#### Project Overview

The **LED Matrix Display** project demonstrates how to use an 8x8 LED matrix with an Arduino Mega to display scrolling text. This project utilizes the MAX7219 driver to control the LED matrix, allowing for easy and efficient control of the LEDs.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **8x8 LED Matrix**
- **MAX7219 LED Driver Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the MAX7219 LED Driver to Arduino Mega:**
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino.
   - **DIN (Data In)**: Connect to digital pin 51 on Arduino.
   - **CLK (Clock)**: Connect to digital pin 52 on Arduino.
   - **CS (Chip Select)**: Connect to digital pin 53 on Arduino.

2. **Connect the LED Matrix to the MAX7219 Driver:**
   - Follow the pin layout provided with the MAX7219 module to ensure correct connections between the driver and the LED matrix.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Assemble the circuit on the breadboard as described in the circuit setup section.
   - Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure and correct.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - After uploading, the LED matrix should display scrolling text.
   - Observe the scrolling "HELLO" text on the LED matrix.

#### Applications

- **Message Display:** Show scrolling messages in public spaces or as part of a project.
- **Decorative Lighting:** Create dynamic lighting effects and patterns.
- **Educational Tool:** Learn about controlling LED matrices and working with hardware drivers.

#### Notes

- **Customize Text:** Modify the `scrollText("HELLO ");` line to display different messages.
- **Font Data:** Extend the `font8x8` array to include more characters as needed.
- **Brightness Control:** Adjust the brightness level by changing the value in `lc.setIntensity(0, 8);`.
